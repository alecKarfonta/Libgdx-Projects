Much of this source comes from this youtube tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJwXzmUQChg&list=SPXY8okVWvwZ0JOwHiH1TntAdq-UDPnC2L

I highly recommend this tutorial, it is some of the most fun I have had coding and he is actively adding videos and even taking requests. 

Although most of this comes from dermetfan's great videos, a good deal was just me playing around and exploring what these libraries can do. Have fun.
