Solar System
============

I started just wanting to write a fairly accurate model of solar system that you could sort of play around with.

It's been more difficult than I thought because all of the values have to be scaled. Not just the sizes and densities of the planets and sun, but also things like the gravitational constant and orbit velocities. The former because the objects would move so slowly, and the latter because we fiddled with the former.

But this led me to the idea of writing an interactive Newton's cannon. Which is a really fun and informative program.
