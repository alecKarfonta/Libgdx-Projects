Angry Mason
===========

This is a game from a tutorial on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP5qA_kgV6Y&list=PL8E5pNjh8OR3f6X4tpjt0M0By6z0sB4MP

This demonstrates how to do a lot in libgdx: input, collision detection, audio... I added a couple things not in the tutorial and tried to do my own graphics, it didnt work out too well.

Controls:

click to shoot in direction of cursor

w,a,s,d: movement
